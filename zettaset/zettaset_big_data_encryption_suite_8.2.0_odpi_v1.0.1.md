2. Primary contact for questions on this questionnaire

John Armstrong – jarmstrong@zettaset.com 

3. Which technologies governed by the ODPi Runtime Specification does this application interoperate with? 

ODPi compliant Hadoop distributions

4. Which ODPi compliant distributions and versions did you test with?  

Hortonworks HDP 2.4.2; IBM IOP 4.1

5. Please describe your application deployment and configuration process (if any). If the application lends itself to be managed by a tool compatible with ODPi Operations specification, please make sure to use the appropriate tool.

Deployment and configuration can be accomplished using Apache Ambari or CLI 

6. Please describe your testing procedure you use to demonstrate compatibility and what passing results will be.

Interoperability pass/fail testing was completed in April 2016 by Hortonworks in their test facility. The Zettaset Big Data Encryption Suite, including BDEncrypt Plus v8.2.0, successfully passed the interoperability tests.  No test data was provided by Hortonworks.  Zettaset achieved “triple” interoperability certification as follows:

a.	HDP – The HDP Certified badge indicates that Zettaset’s Big Data Encryption suite has been certified to work with Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP), reviewed for architectural best practices and validated against a comprehensive suite of integration test cases, benchmarked for scale under varied workloads and comprehensively documented. 
b.	Security Ready - Apache Hadoop is secured with a number of technologies, such as Kerberos, Apache Knox, and Apache Ranger. Security Ready certification indicates the Zettaset solution is integrated with these technologies. 
c.	Operations Ready - Apache Ambari is the open source management fabric for Hadoop. Operations Ready certification indicates the Zettaset solution is integrated with Ambari APIs.

Interoperability pass/fail testing was completed in April 2016 by IBM in their test facility. The Zettaset Big Data Encryption Suite, including BDEncrypt Plus v8.2.0, successfully passed the interoperability tests.  No test data was provided by IBM.

7. What modifications did you make to your software or underlying configurations for each distribution in order for them to pass?

None required

8. Did you test with any ODPicompliant distributions that did not pass your interoperability tests?

No

9. Did you notice any different behavior in your software or the underlying distributions when you ran your tests, whether or not you deemed the tests as passing?

No

10. Which ODPicompliant distributions and versions do you provide support for in the deployment of your software?

The Zettaset Big Data Encryption Suite can support any ODPicompliant distribution.
