## Purpose of this document

This document outlines the explains various how ODPi Compliance designations can be used by organizations to indicate compliance with the ODPi Runtime Specification and ODPi Operations Specification. ODPi Compliance trademarks are intended to be used by organizations to promote their compliance with the big data industry standards governed by ODPi.

### Definitions

**Platform** - A product or service offering that consists of Apache Hadoop™, and optionally includes additional open source and/or commercial components that work with Apache Hadoop™.

**Platform Vendor** - An organization, either a commercial vendor or an open source project, that either produces a packaged version of the Platform or supports a service offering around the platform aimed at end-user consumption.

**Application** - A product that is intended to interoperate with a Platform.

**Software Vendor** - An organization, either a commercial vendor or an open source project, that has a product that works with a Platform.

**End Users** - Users of a Platform and/or Application.

**ODPi Runtime Specification** - Specification developed by the ODPi community, located at [https://github.com/odpi/specs/blob/master/ODPi-Runtime.md](https://github.com/odpi/specs/blob/master/ODPi-Runtime.md).

**ODPi Runtime Test Harness** - Test harness developed by the [Apache Bigtop](https://bigtop.apache.org) community, available for download at [https://www.apache.org/dist/bigtop/1.2.0/bigtop-1.2.0-testsuite.zip](https://www.apache.org/dist/bigtop/1.2.0/bigtop-1.2.0-testsuite.zip).

**ODPi Operations Specification** - Specification developed by the ODPi community, located at [https://github.com/odpi/specs/blob/master/ODPi-Operations.md](https://github.com/odpi/specs/blob/master/ODPi-Operations.md).

**ODPi Operations Test Harness** - Test harness developed by the [Apache Bigtop](https://bigtop.apache.org) community, available for download at [https://www.apache.org/dist/bigtop/1.2.0/bigtop-1.2.0-testsuite.zip](https://www.apache.org/dist/bigtop/1.2.0/bigtop-1.2.0-testsuite.zip).

**ODPi Specification Release** - A release of the ODPi Runtime Specification or ODPi Operations Specification.

**ODPi Compliance Process** - The process defined by the ODPi TSC to validate compliance with an ODPi Specification Release for a Platform Vendor or a Software Vendor.

## Designations

There are three current compliance programs promoted by ODPi for use by organizations for their compliant products. The below sections outline each, describing the program, eligibility, and process for compliance.

### ODPi Runtime Compliant

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Question </td>
    <td>Answer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What is eligible</td>
    <td>Platforms are eligible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What is it</td>
    <td>This designation confirms that a specific version of a Platform has been successfully tested against the ODPi Runtime Specification test harness. The ODPi Runtime Compliant designation attaches to the specific version of the Platform that was tested and must include the ODPi Specification Release version against which the test was successfully completed. All new Platform versions must be re-tested for compliance. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When can a Platform claim to be ODPi Runtime Compliant</td>
    <td>ODPi provides details to End Users about which versions of a Platform are ODPi Runtime Complaint with ODPi Specification Releases.

Initial compliance is achieved when a Platform Vendor has successfully tested a version of their Platform using the ODPi Runtime Test Harness for the given ODPi Specification Release. This should be done following the ODPi Compliance Process and must be verified and approved by the ODPi TSC.  
To show continuing compliance, Platform Vendors should re-complete the ODPi Compliance Process whenever they release a new version of their Platform, or for any future ODPi Specification Release. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How can the ODPi Runtime Compliant Designation be used</td>
    <td>Once a Platform Vendor has successfully tested a version of their Platform using the ODPi Runtime Test Harness, they may request the ODPi Runtime Compliant logo from ODPi. They may use this logo on their product collateral and web pages for the compliant version. They may also use the term "ODPi Runtime Compliant" in their literature, and online, to describe the compliant version in compliance with the ODPi Trademark Policy.  </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Example: Distribution A, Product B, Version 1.2 is Certified as ODPi Runtime V1 Compliant**

### ODPi Operations Compliant

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Question </td>
    <td>Answer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What is eligible</td>
    <td>Platforms are eligible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What is it</td>
    <td>This designation confirms that a specific version of a Platform is following ODPi Operations Specification guidelines. It also confirms that when a platform gets deployed using a bundled Hadoop Management Tool the result is ODPi Runtime compliant. The ODPi Operations Compliant designation attaches to the specific version of the Platform that was tested. All new versions must be re-tested for compliance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When can a Platform claim to be ODPi Operations Compliant</td>
    <td>ODPi provides details to End Users about which versions of a Platform are ODPi Operations Complaint with ODPi Specification Releases.

Initial compliance is achieved when a Platform Vendor has successfully tested a version of their Platform for the given ODPi Specification Release. This should be done following the ODPi Compliance Process and must be verified and approved by the ODPi TSC.  
To show continuing compliance, Platform Vendors should re-complete the ODPi Compliance Process whenever they release a new version of their Platform, or for any future ODPi Specification Release.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How can the ODPi Operations Compliant Designation be used</td>
    <td>Once a Platform Vendor has successfully tested a version of their Platform, they may request the ODPi Operations Compliant logo from ODPi. They may use this logo on their product collateral and web pages for the compliant version. They may also use the term "ODPi Operations Compliant" in their literature, and online, to describe the compliant version in compliance with the ODPi Trademark Policy.  </td>
  </tr>

**Example: Distribution C, Product A, Version 4.2 is Certified as ODPi Operations V1 Compliant**

### ODPi Interoperable

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Question </td>
    <td>Answer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What is eligible</td>
    <td>Applications are eligible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What is it</td>
    <td>This designation confirms that a specific version of an Application leverages the components as outlined in a specific version of the ODPi Specification Release. The ODPi Interoperable designation attaches to the specific version of the Application AND the specific version of the ODPi Specification Release. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When can an Application claim to be ODPi Interoperable</td>
    <td>ODPi provides details to End Users about which versions of an Application are ODPi Interoperable.

Initial compliance is achieved when a Software Vendor has successfully confirmed that the version for which they seek the designation is interoperable with two or more Distributions that are compliant with the ODPi Specification Release, following the ODPi Compliance Process, and verified and approved by the ODPi TSC.

To show continuing compliance, Application Vendors should  re-complete the ODPi Compliance Process whenever they release a new version of their Application, or the ODPi Specification releases a new version.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How can the ODPi Interoperable designation be used</td>
    <td>After compliance has been confirmed, a Software Vendor may request the ODPi Interoperable logo from ODPi. They may use this logo on their product collateral and web pages for the compliant version. They may also use the term "ODPi Interoperable" in their literature, and online, to describe the compliant version. In addition, ODPi will look to advertise the Application compliance in ODPi marketing literature.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Level of ODPi compliance required from a distribution used for testing</td>
    <td>ODPi Interoperable designation can only be awarded when an application gets tested on an ODPi Runtime Compliant distribution. ODPi strongly encourages, but doesn't currently require, testing on Distributions that are also ODPi Operations Compliant. ODPi Core reference implementation and a few popular commercial Distributions are both ODPi Runtime and ODPi Operations Compliant and thus represent an ideal choice for testing applications for ODPi Interoperable designation.</td>
